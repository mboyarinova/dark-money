            life is significantly more difficult. In this case players were
            warned to be on the lookout for special interests, and have materials
            presented to close in on the source. In real life the voter doesnâ€™t
            necessarily know they should be looking, and they are inundated with
            hundreds of materials making different arguments. This case was
            solvable. Most are not.*/}
