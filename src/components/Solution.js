              This game is intended to be fun, challenging, and informative. As
              realistic as we strived to make it, tracing these scenarios in
              real life is significantly more difficult. In this case players
              were warned to be on the lookout for special interests, and have
              materials presented to close in on the source. In real life the
              voter doesnâ€™t necessarily know they should be looking, and they
              are inundated with hundreds of materials making different
              arguments. This case was solvable. Most are not.
